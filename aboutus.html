    <p>I'm Niskriti,a passionate web developer and book lover. I started this bookshop website to combine my love for reading with my newfound skills in web development.</p>
    <p><h3>Our Mission</h3>
      At Novel Nest, my goal is to create a welcoming online space where fellow book enthusiasts can discover and purchase their favorite books. I believe that every book has a story to tell, and I'm dedicated to making that experience enjoyable and accessible for everyone.

      <p><h3>What We Offer</h3>
        As a beginner in web development, I'm continuously learning and improving. Here, you'll find a curated selection of books across various genres, including [mention some genres you're focusing on, like fiction, non-fiction, children's books, etc.]. Each title is chosen with care to ensure there's something for every reader.

        I began this journey since October,2024. Along the way, I'm learning to create a user-friendly and visually appealing site that reflects my passion for literature. I'm excited to share my progress and welcome you to join me on this adventure!
